This gedit plugin provides a highlight syntax mode for the song files ".sg"

This package provides two files songbook.lang and songbook.xml .
Copy songbook.lang in ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs
and  songbook.xml  in ~/.local/share/mime/packages

Make the folders if they do not already exist.

Files are hosted as a git project on github:
